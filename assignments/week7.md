Homework 7

Due Friday,  October 15.

A. 

1.  What is the most common way of choosing the number of nodes in the hidden layer?
2.  How is overfitting typically handled in neural networks, and how does this contrast with approaches typically taken with linear classifiers?
3.  Describe the difference between backpropagation and forward propagation.
4.  What is the vanishing gradient problem, and when is it actually a problem? (You may have to do a web search.)
5.  Name three disadvantages of using neural networks vs. using a simpler classifier.

B.  

Using the Iris data and the sports data from previous assignments, run VW using neural networks and some other classifier (e.g., logistic regression, hinge loss, squared loss).  
Since you have already converted the data to the VW format, this should not take much time.
Compute accuracy on both train and test data, splitting them as necessary.

Tweak at least two "variables" and analyze how they affect performance:

The following are suggestions of variables to tweak.  You are free to use others.
* Size of the training data
* Number of hidden layers (depth) of the neural network
* Regularization
* Early stopping
* Number of passes
