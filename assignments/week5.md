A.  Note that "Explain" can be interpreted to mean "Explain as briefly as possible."

1.  What is the VC dimension of a f(x) = sin(ax), where *a* is a parameter that you can set arbitrarily?  Argue your case.
    You may use pictures.
    
2.  T/F  The-VC dimension is the maximum number of point that can be shattered in an infinite number of ways.  Explain.
    
3.  T/F  SVMs, logistic regression, and perceptrons are all examples of "families of functions."  Explain.

4.  T/F  Determining the empirical Rademacher Complexity is NP-hard. Explain.
    

5.  T/F SVMs, Na√Øve Bayes, and logistic regression all find a hyperplane to separate data.
    If there is something incorrect about this statement, explain what it is and why.

6.  What is a Rademacher variable, and what function does it serve in terms of determining Rademacher complexity? Explain.

B.  Using Vowpal Wabbit, using the data provided for Programming Assignemnt 2, run the experiment with at least two different
    loss functions (or neural networks or SVMs) and compare the results.  How does using L2 regularization affect the results?
    
C.  Go to https://www.kaggle.com/datasets and browse the data sets.  
    Describe at least two projects you would be interested in tackling and why.
