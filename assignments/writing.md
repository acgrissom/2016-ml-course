Writing Assignment


--
* Final Draft Due: Dec. 5
* Last day for rough drafts: Nov. 21

For this assignment, you will address an ethical question relevant to contemporary machine learning in an essay.  This essay must be well-written: it must be written in standard, grammatical English, contain well-organized thoughts, and employ structured argumentation in support of a position.  The length must be at least two but no more than four pages when using the ICML template.  Essays will be graded based on both content and grammar.  Slopily written essays will be returned ungraded.
You may send me a draft if you are unsure whether your essay meets the standards required for credit.  Office hours, scheduled or otherwise, are also a good time for this.

Throughout the semester, I have shared with you various articles.  You are free to use any of the issues raised by these as a basis of your essay.  You may also use others.  If you are unsure regarding whether your topic is appropriate, you should ask me.

This essay does not require that you take an absolutist position.  It does, however, necessitate that you examine an issue critically.  Below, I have provided some recent resouces that may be of help in selecting a topic.
